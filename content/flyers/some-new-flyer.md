  Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining
  Avengers -- Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner -- must figure
  out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with
  Thanos -- the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe.
