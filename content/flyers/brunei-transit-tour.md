  In 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse
  Eisenberg) begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global
  social network known as Facebook. Six years later, he is one of the youngest
  billionaires ever, but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads
  to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end
  of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).
