      One of the premier destinations in northern Taiwan, Yehliu Geopark is home
      to a number of unique geological formations including the iconic "Queen's
      Head", and is located along a cape stretching out from the town of Wanli.
      Part of the Daliao Miaocene Formation, the cape stretches around 1,700
      meters, formed as thousands of years of geological movement forced the
      Datun Mountains to change their shape, jutting out into the ocean.

      Built by the Japanese during a Gold Rush frenzy, the village started its

      photogenic streets lit by strings of lanterns, quaint historical
      architecture, and its combo ocean and mountain views.
