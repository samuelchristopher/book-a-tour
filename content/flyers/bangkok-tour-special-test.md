  In 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse
  Eisenberg) begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global
  social network known as Facebook. Six years later, he is one of the youngest

  to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end
  of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).
