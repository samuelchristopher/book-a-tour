  Singapore, an island city-state off southern Malaysia, is a global financial
  center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core
  centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by
  grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In
  Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic
  Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth.
