  Singapore, an island city-state off southern Malaysia, is a global financial
  center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core
  centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by
  grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In
  Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic
  Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth.

      A hawker is a vendor of merchandise that can be easily transported; the
      term is roughly synonymous with peddler or costermonger. In most places
      where the term is used, a hawker sells inexpensive items, handicrafts or
      food items.

      Sentosa is an island resort off Singaporeâ€™s southern coast, connected to
      the city by road, cable car, pedestrian boardwalk and monorail. By Sentosa
      Station, Tiger Sky Tower has panoramic views that can stretch as far as
      Indonesia. On the south coast, Palawan Beach is lined with food stalls and
      bars, and has a suspension bridge to a small offshore island. Palm-lined,
      crescent-shaped Tanjong Beach is more tranquil.
